# isomorphic-git example projects

Starting a project can be tricky!
To help, I'm going to start collecting example projects here in this repo.
Hopefully having a working example and its config will be a useful resource.

## To install

```
git clone https://github.com/isomorphic-git/examples
```

Then `cd` into one of the examples and follow the README in there.

## Current Examples

- `typescript-node` - a simple TypeScript + Node.js application
- `ReactNativeGit` - a React Native application using `react-native-fs` (and a fair amount of wrapper code)
